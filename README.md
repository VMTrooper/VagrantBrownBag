===============
Steps as laid out in the .PPT or .PDF work just fine with VirtualBox.  I may eventually turn those files into a Repository Wiki...

To use this code with VMware {Fusion..Workstation}...

0. Download, Install, AND **License** VMware Fusion or Workstation

1. Obtain a **License** for the VMware plugin from http://www.vagrantup.com

2. Install the VMware plugin: vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-fusion or vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-workstation

3. License the VMware plugin: vagrant plugin license vagrant-vmware-fusion or vagrant plugin license vagrant-vmware-workstation

4. Follow along with the steps in the PowerPoint or PDF.

* Consult http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vmware/installation.html if Steps 2 and 3 aren't successful

**NOTE:** Emphasis added because folks sometimes are surprised when things cost money :-)
